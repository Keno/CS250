(* Write a function ieval_com : nat -> com -> state -> option state
   which takes "fuel" as an argument and tries to run the command
   for fuel-number of steps.  If the command terminates in that time,
   then you should return the resulting state, and if it doesn't
   terminate in that time, you should return None.  
*)

(* Prove that :

   eval_com c s1 s2 -> exists n, ieval_com n c s1 = Some s2.

*)

(* Prove that : 

   ieval_com n c s1 = Some s2 -> eval_com c s1 s2

*)

(* Write a function

     optimize_com : com -> com

   which tries to optimize a command and the sub-expressions 
   within it.  In particular, your optimizer should at least:

   * replace (a + 0) and (0 + a) with a
   * replace (a - 0) with a
   * replace (a * 1) and (1 * a) with a
   * replace (a * 0) and (0 * a) with 0

   * replace (a == a) with Tt
   * replace (a < a) with Ff
   * replace (Tt && Tt) with Tt
   * replace (Tt || b) and (b || Tt) with Tt
   * replace (Ff && b) and (b && Ff) with Ff

   * replace (skip ; c) and (c ; skip) with c
   * replace (if Tt c1 else c2) with c1
   * replace (if Ff c1 else c2) with c2
*)

(* Construct a proof that optimizing a program doesn't change its
   input/output behavior.  That is, show that if we start in state
   s1 and evaluate c to get state s2, then if we evaluate 
   optimize_com(c) in state s1, we get out a state that is
   extensionally equivalent to s2.

(* Hints:

   * You *will* get stuck doing this assignment.  It is hard.
     Don't hesitate to ask questions on Piazza or in class, 
     or collaborate with friends to solve this.  
     
   * When proving ieval_com is equivalent to eval_com, you will
     find the following lemma very useful:

     ieval_plus : forall n c s1 s2, 
       ieval_com n c s1 = Some s2 -> 
         forall m, ieval_com (n + m) c s1 = Some s2

    This says that if it takes n steps to get an answer out,
    then if you run for more than n steps, you still get the
    same answer out.

   * Write a simple optimizer first, and prove that correct.
     Don't try to write a complicated optimizer first.  It's
     easier to "grow" your development incrementally.  

  * You will find the following tactic very useful:

       remember(<exp>) as <id>

    Consider a proof state like this:

        H : P (foo + bar + baz)
        -----------------------------------------
        match foo + bar + baz with 
          | 0 => blah
          | S n => blahblah
        end

    Executing the tactic

        remember (foo + bar + baz) as x

    will leave you in the state:

        x : nat
        Hxeq : x = foo + bar + baz
        H : P x
        -----------------------------------------
        match x with 
          | 0 => blah
          | S n => blahblah
        end

    So "remember" just helps you name a sub-expression in 
    a proof, and replace all occurrences of that sub-expression
    with that name.  You can always undo the substitution by
    rewriting by the Hxeq equation.

  * There are many useful arithmetic facts in the libraries
    (e.g., plus_0_r, NPeano.Nat.sub_0_r, mult_comm, etc.) 
    Don't forget to use "SearchAbout" to find them.

  * If you [Require Import Omega.] then you can use the "omega"
    tactic to solve some arithmetic questions.  

  * You will want to define a comparison operation for arithmetic
    expressions.  The natural thing to write is something like:

       eq_aexp : aexp -> aexp -> bool

    but you will then need to prove that this is actually correct
    i.e., (eq_aexp a1 a2 = true) <-> (a1 = a2).

    An alternative is to define something like:

      eq_aexp_dec : forall (a1 a2:aexp), {a1 = a2} + {a1<>a2}.

    and instead of trying to build it using explicit code, use
    the "decide quality" tactic (two words.)  For instance:

    Definition eq_aexp_dec (a1 a2:aexp) : {a1=a2} + {a1<>a2}.
      decide quality.
      apply (eq_nat_dec n n0).
      apply (string_dec v v0).
      decide equality.
    Defined.

    This tactic will take an inductive definition and try to
    build the decidable equality term for you.  In the example
    above, I had to tell it how to decide quality for some of
    the types used within the definition (nats, strings, and
    binops.)  

  * You may also find the tactic:

       replace (<exp1>) with (<exp2>) 

    useful.  As suggested, it lets you replace occurrences of 
    one expression with another.  It leaves you with two goals:
    The first is the original goal with the substitution performed.
    The second is a requirement to prove <exp1> = <exp2>. 

  * My solution for this whole file (not including these comments)
    is about 400 lines of code.  Yours will be much, much bigger
    unless you use a lot of automation.
