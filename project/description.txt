Modelling Julia

Who
Jao-ke Chin-Lee and Keno Fischer

What
We will model a subset of Julia's type inference [1], and will attempt to prove its termination (or determine whether it's hard to prove its termination) and correctness.

How
We will begin by implementing the type inference algorithm and type lattice, starting without subtypes, parametric types or types as values, and attempting to prove termination and/or correctness. Then, we will add types as values, subtypes, and parametric types, building up the type lattice, and attempting to maintain the proofs as we go, seeing where they break if they do.
